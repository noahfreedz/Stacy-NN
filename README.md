Stacy is an open-source neural network designed for handwritten number identification. Noah and I (Scott) were tasked with building a data processing system for a final project. We decided to majorly overcomplicate it and build a neural network using nothing but the standard C++ library and select other libraries for data management and visualization.

After extensive research and coding, Rebecca was born. While Rebecca was quite rough, we managed to work out the major issues - the AI learned a bit, but fine-tuning remained elusive. We turned in the final project and received a 100%. Afterward, we decided to pivot.

We created a new repository and renamed the model to Stacy. While keeping the core foundation of Rebecca, we're planning a complete rebuild. We have big plans for Stacy and are looking forward to everything we'll learn along the way. Rebecca remains a public library for anyone interested in checking it out - it can be found under Noah's profile as CSI-281-Final.
